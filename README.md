INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
composer create-project --prefer-dist yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


**NOTES:** 
- Minimum required Docker engine version `17.04` for development (see [Performance tuning for volume mounts](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs-caching/))
- The default configuration uses a host-volume in your home directory `.docker-composer` for composer caches


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Database mongodb

Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data, for example:

```php
return [
    'class' => 'yii\mongodb\Connection',
    'dsn'=> 'mongodb+srv://usuario:password@cluster0.7tvfdgo.mongodb.net/',
    'defaultDatabaseName' => 'library',  //name of your database
];
```

TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](https://codeception.com/).
By default, there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
vendor/bin/codecept run
```

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser.
